## Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF)

![](/images/aws/00-icons/swf.png) 
- Build and run background jobs with
	- parallel or sequential steps
	- synchronously or asynchronously
	- with human inputs (can indefinitely wait for human inputs)
- (Use cases) Order processing and video encoding workflows
- A workflow can start when receiving an order, receiving a request for a taxi
- Workflows can run upto 1 year
- Deciders and activity workers can use long polling

## Amazon SWF - Order Process

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-actors.html
- Key Actors : Workflow starter, Decider and Activity worker
- Workflow starter calls SWF action to start workflow 
	- Example: when an order is received
- SWF receives request and schedules a decider
	- Decider receives the task and returns decision to SWF: 
		- For example, schedule an activity "Activity 1"
	- SWF schedules "Activity 1"
	- Activity worker performs "Activity 1". Returns result to SWF.
	- SWF updates workflow history. Schedules another decision task.
	- Loop continues until decider returns decision to close workflow
- SWF archives history and closes workflow

## AWS Step Functions

- Create a serverless workflow in 10 Minutes using a visual approach
- Orchestrate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows:
	- Invoke an AWS Lambda function
	- Run an Amazon Elastic Container Service or AWS Fargate task
	- Get an existing item from an Amazon DynamoDB table or put a new item into a DynamoDB table
	- Publish a message to an Amazon SNS topic
	- Send a message to an Amazon SQS queue
- Build workflows as a series of steps:
	- Output of one step flows as input into next step
	- Retry a step multiple times until it succeeds
	- Maximum duration of 1 year

## AWS Step Functions 

![](/images/aws/00-icons/stepfunctions.png) 
- Integrates with Amazon API Gateway
	- Expose API around Step Functions
	- Include human approvals into workflows
- (Use case) Long-running workflows 
	- Machine learning model training, report generation, and IT automation
- (Use case) Short duration workflows 
	- IoT data ingestion, and streaming data processing
- (Benefits) Visual workflows with easy updates and less code
- (Alternative) Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) 
	- Complex orchestration code  (external signals,  launch child processes)
- Step Functions is recommended for all new workflows UNLESS you need to write complex code for orchestration
