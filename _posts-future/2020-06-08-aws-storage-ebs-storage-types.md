## Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

![](/images/aws/001-basic-drawings/04-ebs.png)
- **Network block storage** attached to your EC2 instance
- **Provisioned capacity**
- Very flexible. 
	- **Increase size when you need it** - when attached to EC2 instance
- Independent lifecycle from EC2 instance
	- Attach/Detach from one EC2 instance to another
- 10X more durable compared to an usual hard disk (annual failure rate of 0.1% - 0.2%)
- *99.999% Availability* & replicated within the same AZ
- **Use case** : Run your custom database

## Hard Disk Drive vs Solid State Drive

> Amazon EBS offers HDD and SSD options! <BR/>How do you choose between them?

|Feature|HDD(Hard Disk Drive)|SSD(Solid State Drive)|
|--|:--|:--|
|Performance - IOPS| Low | High|
|Throughput| High | High|
|Great at| Large sequential I/O operations |Small, Random I/O operations &<BR/> Sequential I/O|
|Recommended for| Large streaming or big data workloads| Transactional workloads|
|Cost| Low| Expensive|
|Boot Volumes|Not Recommended| Recommended|

## Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) SSD Types

##### General Purpose SSD (gp2) ($$$)
- I/O performance **increases with size** - 3 IOPS/GB (min 100) upto 16,000 IOPS
- **Balance price & performance** for transactional workloads (Cost sensitive)
- **Use cases** : small/medium databases, dev/test environments, & boot volumes
- **Burst** up to 3,000 IOPS above the baseline

##### Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) ($$$$)
- Provision IOPS you need
- Designed for **low latency transactional** workloads
- Delivers consistent performance for **random and sequential** access
- **Use cases** : large relational or NoSQL databases

## Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) HDD Types

![](/images/aws/00-icons/ebs.png) 

##### Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) ($$)
- For **frequently accessed, throughput-intensive sequential** workloads
- **Use cases** : MapReduce, Kafka, log processing, data warehouse, and ETL

##### Cold HDD (sc1) ($)
- Lowest Cost
- **Use cases** : infrequent data access - very low transaction databases

## Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Types
|                       | Provisioned IOPS SSD | General Purpose SSD | Throughput Optimized HDD | Cold HDD |
|--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Volume Size           | 4 GB - 16 TB         | 1 GB - 16 TB        | 500 GB - 16 TB           | 500 GB - 16 TB |
| Max IOPS/Volume       | 64,000               | 16,000              | 500                      | 250            |
| Max Throughput/Volume | 1,000 MB/s           | 250 MB/s            | 500 MB/s                 | 250 MB/s       |
| Boot Volume | ✓          | ✓           |         X        |   X     |

## Amazon EBS Types - Summary

![](/images/aws/00-icons/ebs.png) 
- **Cold HDD**: Infrequent access usecases (minimum cost)
- **Throughput Optimized HDD**: Frequently accessed, large sequential operations with high throughput (cost sensitive)
- **General Purpose SSD**: System boot volumes and transactional workloads
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD**: Transactional workloads needing very high IOPS
