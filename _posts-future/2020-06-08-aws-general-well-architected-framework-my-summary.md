## Well Architected Framework

![](/images/aws/00-icons/aws.png) 
- Helps cloud architects build application infrastructure which is:
	- Secure
	- High-performing
	- Resilient and
	- Efficient
- You can find the complete framework here - https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/
- Five Pillars
	- Operational Excellence
	- Security
	- Reliability
	- Performance Efficiency
	- Cost Optimization

## Operational Excellence

![](/images/aws/00-icons/cloudformation.png)
![](/images/aws/00-icons/codepipeline.png) 

- Avoid/Minimize effort and problems with
	- Provisioning servers
	- Deployment
	- Monitoring
	- Support

## Operational Excellence - Solutions and AWS services

## Security Pillar
![](/images/aws/00-icons/iam.png) 
![](/images/aws/00-icons/shield.png) 
![](/images/aws/00-icons/waf.png) 

- Principle of least privilege for least time
- Security in Depth - Apply security in all layers
- Protect Data in Transit and at rest
- Actively monitor for security issues
- Centralize security policies for multiple AWS accounts

## Security Pillar - Principle of least privilege for least time
![](/images/aws/00-icons/iam.png)
- Use temporary credentials when possible (IAM roles, Instance profiles)
- Use IAM Groups to simplify IAM management
- Enforce strong password practices
- Enforce MFA
- Rotate credentials regularly

## Security Pillar - Security in Depth

![](/images/aws/00-icons/shield.png) 
![](/images/aws/00-icons/waf.png) 
![](/images/aws/00-icons/cloudformation.png) 

- VPCs and Private Subnets
	- Security Groups
	- Network Access Control List (NACL)
- Use hardened EC2 AMIs (golden image)
	- Automate patches for OS, Software etc
- Use CloudFront with AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation
- Use WAF with CloudFront and ALB 
	- Protect web applications from CSS, SQL injection etc
- Use CloudFormation
	 - Automate provisioning infrastructure that adheres to security policies

## Security Pillar - Protecting Data at Rest

![](/images/aws/00-icons/kms.png) 
![](/images/aws/00-icons/cloudhsm.png)
- Enable Versioning (when available)
- Enable encryption - KMS and Cloud HSM
	- Rotate encryption keys

	- SSE-C, SSE-S3, SSE-KMS
- Amazon DynamoDB
	- Encryption Client, SSE-KMS
- Amazon Redshift
	- AWS KMS and AWS CloudHSM
- Amazon EBS, Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS
	- AWS KMS
- Amazon RDS
	- AWS KMS, TDE

## Security Pillar - Protecting Data in Transit 
![](/images/aws/00-icons/certificatemanager.png)
- Data coming in and going out of AWS
- By default, all AWS API use HTTPS/SSL
- You can also choose to perform client side encryption for additional security
- Ensure that your data goes through AWS network as much as possible
	- VPC Endpoints and AWS PrivateLink

## Security Pillar - Detect Threats
![](/images/aws/00-icons/cloudwatch.png)
![](/images/aws/00-icons/organizations.png)
- Actively monitor for security issues:
	- Monitor CloudWatch Logs
	- Use Amazon GuardDuty to detect threats and continuously monitor for malicious behavior
- Use AWS Organization to centralize security policies for multiple AWS accounts

## Reliability

	- Recover from infrastructure and application issues
	- Adapt to changing demands in load

## Reliability - Best Practices
![](/images/aws/00-icons/autoscaling.png)
![](/images/aws/00-icons/cloudwatchalarm.png)
![](/images/aws/00-icons/cloudwatch.png)
- Automate recovery from failure
	- Health checks and Auto scaling
	- Managed services like RDS can automatically switch to standby
- Scale horizontally
	- Reduces impact of single failure
- Maintain Redundancy
	- Multiple Direct Connect connections
	- Multiple Regions and Availability Zones
- Prefer serverless architectures
- Prefer loosely coupled architectures
	- SQS, SNS
- Distributed System Best Practices
	- Use Amazon API Gateway for throttling requests
	- AWS SDK provides retry with exponential backoff

## Loosely coupled architectures
