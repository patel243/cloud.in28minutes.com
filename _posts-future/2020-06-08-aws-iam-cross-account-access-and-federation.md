## IAM Role Use case : Cross Account Access

- PROD Account (111111111111)
	- Create IAM role (ProdS3AccessRole) with right permissions and establish trust relationship with AWS account 222222222222
- DEV Account (222222222222)
	- Grant users (Operations Group) permissions to assume the ProdS3AccessRole in PROD Account 
		- Create a customer managed policy ProdS3AccessPolicy allowing access to call STS AssumeRole API for ProdS3AccessRole(arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/ProdS3AccessRole)
		- Assign the policy to users (Operations Group)
		- (Optional) Enable MFA for assuming the role
- Operations user requests access to the role
	- Background: Call is made to AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) AssumeRole API for the ProdS3AccessRole role
	- Gets access!

## IAM  - Corporate Directory Federation
![](/images/aws/iam2.png)

- Users authenticated with **a corporate directory**
	- For SAML2.0 compliant identity systems, establish a trust relationship with IAM
	- For enterprise using Microsoft AD (Active Directory), use AWS Directory Service to establish trust
	- Otherwise, set up a custom proxy server to translate user identities from enterprise to IAM roles

## IAM  - Web Identity Federation

- Authenticate users using **web identities** - mobile or web apps
- Example: Open ID (Facebook, Google, etc)
- **Amazon Cognito** supports login with Facebook, Google, or other OpenID Connect compatible IdP
- Configure Role to use Web Identity as trusted entity 
	- Authentication tokens exchanged using **STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity** API
